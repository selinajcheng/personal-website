<h2>Chapter 1 - What makes for a dream job?</h2>
<p>
    Finding a dream job that's enjoyable and meaningful doesn't involve a) discovering passion through a flash of insight, or b) a job that is easy and high-paid.

<blockquote>
    Rather, you can develop passion while doing work that you find enjoyable and meaningful.

    Past $75,000, increases in income do not substantially affect happiness, sadness, or stress. Past $50,000, increases in income do not affect life satisfaction. High-earning jobs do not equate to high levels of happiness. For reference, these statements are based on Kahneman and A. Deaton's 2010 study.

<blockquote>
    Many people tell us they want to "find a job that's not too stressful." [...] One puzzle is that studies of high-ranking government and military leaders found they had <i>lower</i> levels of stress hormones and less anxiety, despite sleeping fewer hours, managing more people and having greater demands placed upon them.
